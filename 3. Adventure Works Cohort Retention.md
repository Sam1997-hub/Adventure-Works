Inference from the heatmap:
1. In the initial days it was seen that there were subsequent null values which might mean one of 2 things:i)Lack of data for the previous periods ii) Customers becoming inactive immediately after acquisition
2. The retention seems to have increased in later cohorts; it seems that there were better retention efforts or strategy changes in the later periods.
3.Comparing cohorts from the same month in different years might reveal seasonality effects on customer behavior.
4.The long term retention can be crucial for understanding customer lifetime value and tailoring marketing strategies.

Actions based upon the retention matrix:

1. Improving early retention strategies like onboarding processes,engagement programs or loyalty rewards.
2. Targetted marketing to try and identify cohorts that can be retained well in order to duplicate the marketing strategies for the future.
3. Understand the customer lifecycle and implement personalized re-engagement campaigns for customers at risk of churning after specific periods
4. Analyze why some cohorts perform better than others and apply those learnings across all customer efforts.
